        <h1>Terms and Conditions</h1>
        <p class="effective-date">Effective Date: February 19, 2026</p>

        <p>These Terms and Conditions ("Terms") govern your use of the AI-powered phone ordering services provided by GauchoTech ("we," "our," or "us"). By using our services, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>

        <h2>1. Service Description</h2>
        <p>GauchoTech provides an AI-powered phone answering and order-taking system for restaurants. Our system answers incoming calls, takes customer food orders, and transmits order details to the restaurant via SMS notifications and digital order logs.</p>

        <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
        <p>Our services are intended for use by restaurant owners and operators. By signing up, you represent that you have the authority to enter into this agreement on behalf of the restaurant or business.</p>

        <h2>3. Restaurant Partner Obligations</h2>
        <p>As a restaurant partner, you agree to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Provide accurate and up-to-date menu information, pricing, and hours of operation.</li>
            <li>Notify GauchoTech promptly of any changes to your menu, pricing, or availability.</li>
            <li>Fulfill orders received through our system in a timely manner.</li>
            <li>Maintain the quality and safety of food prepared for orders placed through our service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. SMS Notifications</h2>
        <p>By providing your phone number during onboarding, you consent to receive SMS order notifications from our system. Standard messaging rates from your carrier may apply. You may opt out of SMS notifications at any time by replying STOP to any message or contacting us directly.</p>

        <h2>5. Order Accuracy</h2>
        <p>While we strive for high accuracy in processing customer orders, our AI system may occasionally make errors in order transcription. GauchoTech is not liable for losses resulting from order inaccuracies. Restaurant partners are encouraged to verify orders before preparation when possible.</p>

        <h2>6. Pricing and Payment</h2>
        <p>Service fees and payment terms will be outlined in a separate service agreement between GauchoTech and the restaurant partner. We reserve the right to modify pricing with 30 days' written notice.</p>

        <h2>7. Service Availability</h2>
        <p>We aim to provide reliable, uninterrupted service but do not guarantee 100% uptime. GauchoTech is not liable for losses resulting from service outages, technical failures, or disruptions caused by third-party providers.</p>

        <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
        <p>GauchoTech's service is built using third-party technologies and platforms. All underlying software and systems are the property of their respective owners. The specific configuration, prompts, workflows, and processes we use to deliver our service are proprietary to GauchoTech. Restaurant partners may not attempt to reverse-engineer, replicate, or independently recreate our service setup.</p>

        <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, GauchoTech shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages arising from the use of our service, including but not limited to lost revenue, lost orders, or customer complaints.</p>

        <h2>10. Termination</h2>
        <p>Either party may terminate the service agreement at any time with 7 days' written notice. Upon termination, GauchoTech will cease processing calls for the restaurant and delete stored data upon request.</p>

        <h2>11. Modifications to Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify restaurant partners of material changes via email or SMS. Continued use of our service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Terms.</p>

        <h2>12. Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of California.</p>

        <h2>13. Contact Us</h2>
